31.9 The chosen team structure is the open paradigm, since the work carried out in this structure causes everyone to work collaboratively, with strong communication and decision-making based on consensus. The model used would be the spiral because it is an evolutionary process model that couples the iterative nature of prototyping with the systematic and controlled aspects of the cascade model. It provides potential for the rapid development of increasingly complete versions of the software. When using this model, the software will be developed in a series of versions. In the first iterations, the version can consist of a model or even a prototype and in the next iterations the software becomes more and more complete.

34.5 Adding people with the process in progress may not delay the project, what may happen is that new people who are entering will learn from the old people who are already aware of the whole project, hence the time productive development. You can add people, but only in a planned and well coordinated way.
